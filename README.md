CustomOreGen
============

A revival of the Custom Ore Generation mod for Minecraft, originally
by the great JRoush, who sadly seems to have disappeared. This code is
the result of decompilation and is released without explicit
permission of JRoush, but his copyright notice seemed to be compatible
with the Artistic 2.0 license. Thus, that license has been applied to
this code. Anyone who distributes this code needs to give clear credit
to JRoush.

Most features are documented on the (still current)
[wiki](http://custom-ore-generation.wikia.com/wiki/).
